## General

- [ ] Replace `IntegerRage.expandRangeToSet(...)` with a class implementation that keeps track of removed indexes.  
  This way it is much more efficient.
- [ ] Review APIs (classes, simplify as much as possible/re-organize at least)
- [ ] Rename cells to VFXxxx (?)
- [ ] Implement paginated Grid (?)
- [ ] Implement paginated Table
