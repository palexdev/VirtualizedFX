**This is a temporary branch to update MaterialFX dependencies to their latest version. This, however, requires bumping
the JDK version to 24. Later this year, this as well as MaterialFX, will be updated to JDK 25.
~~There are no extra features or bug fixes on this branch!~~ New features and fixes are immediately cherry-picked and released on the main branch**
