## Type of Changes

- **Added** for new features.
- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.
- **Removed** for now removed features.
- **Fixed** for any bug fixes.

## [11.9.6] - 04-06-2023

### Changed

- For convenience, now controls are not styled by default, an enumerator allows to easily retrieve the needed
  stylesheets
- TableHelper: improve autosize columns code
- TableHelper: improved layoutInitialized detection

## [11.9.5] - 04-06-2023

### Added

- TableHelper, PaginatedHelper: added property to check when the table fully completes its layout pass

### Changed

- DefaultTableColumnSkin: use the columnSizeProperty() only if the set width is greater than 0, otherwise it falls back
  to the standard computation

### Fixed

- Ditch the buggy getUserAgentStylesheet() method and use getStylesheets() instead to style the controls
- VirtualTable: use the new aforementioned layoutInitializedProperty() to autosize columns instead of the Skin and Width
  properties. The fact that the skin is not null anymore, and that the width has changed is not a valid indicator of the
  table's layout state

## [11.9.4] - 29-05-2023

## Added

- VirtualTable: added convenience method to autosize columns

## Changed

- Update Gradle to version 8.1.1
- Update JavaFX plugin to version 0.0.14
- Update JavaFX to version 20.0.1
- Update MFXCore to version 11.6.2
- Update MFXEffects to version 11.2.1
- Update MFXResources to version 11.7.0
- Update JUnito to version 5.9.2
- DefaultTableColumnSkin: improved minimum width computation in VARIABLE layout mode to be at least the size of the
  header
- TableHelper: remove computeEstimatedSize() method override from the VariableHelper. The method has also been changed
  so that the virtual width/breadth is always computed as the sum of all the columns' width
- TableHelper: improved layout algorithm in general. Rows now use the virtual width as their width to cover all the
  table even when scrolling. Improved size computation of the last table column. Do not constraint the column' sizes
  here anymore, just use LayoutUtils.boundWidth(...)
- VirtualTableSkin: use the virtual width as the width for the viewport during layout

## Fixed

- DefaultTableColumn: fix inViewport property not updating correctly in VARIABLE layout mode
- DefaultTableColumnSkin: fixed sizes not updating when switching layout mode due to JavaFX caching the previous results

## [11.9.3] - 11-04-2023

## Changed

- Bump JavaFX to v19.0.2
- Bump MFXCore to v11.3.1

## [11.9.2] - 08-04-2023

## Changed

- Bump MFXResources to version 11.3.3

## Added

- Added MFXEffects as animations were moved from core to this

## Changed

- Upgrade MFXCore to version 11.3.0 to avoid conflicts with older versions in which the module was still called "
  MFXCore" (changed to "mfx.core")
- Upgrade MFXResources to version 11.3.2

## Fixed

- GridRow: typo, rIndex must be oIndex when processing reusable cells (thanks to Alexander-Ploskin #11)

## [11.9.0] - 16-03-2023

## Changed

- Upgrade MFXResources to version 11.2.0. This should fix issues when using newer versions of VirtualizedFX in
  combination with MaterialFX

  if both ranges are equal but target size must be updated

## [11.8.4] - 31-01-2023

## Changed

- DefaultTableColumn: improve overlay display by adding a new CSS PseudoClass ":dragged" that is enabled by the
  RegionDragResizer when the column is being resized. Previously the resize was causing the overlay to "flicker" because
  it was only shown when the mouse was hover the column header
- DefaultTableColumn: moved RegionDragResizer setup to separate protected method, allowing custom implementation to
  change it
- VirtualScrollPaneSkin: add listener to the content bounds property to show the scroll bars when the virtual bounds
  change

## Added

- VirtualScrollPane: introduce new property to shift the positions of the scroll bars (will be useful for VirtualTable)

## Changed

- Flow Viewport Manager: lastRange property must be reset during clear()
- GridState: it may rarely happen that after the init() computation some rows are still present in the old state, make
  sure to clean up
- Grid ViewportManager: reset last ranges properties during clear()

## Fixed

- Emergency fix for some regressions and newfound nasty bugs
- Flow ViewportManager: do not init() if the items list is empty. Could occur in some very rare cases
- VirtualFlowSkin: discovered a rare bug which caused the cells to not being laid out properly if the viewport was all
  the way down and the cell factory was being switched (yes very specific situation)
- GridHelper: removed invalidatedPos() call that was causing incorrect state computation in very specific occasions
- Grid ViewportManager: improper state object was being used in onChange() computation
- VirtualGridSkin: discovered a rare bug which caused the cells to not being laid out properly if the viewport was all
  the way down and the cell factory was being switched (yes very specific situation)
- VSPUtils: fixed bindings for VirtualFlow wrapping, invalidation must be invoked through biInvalidate() since the
  binding is bidirectional

## [11.7.1] - 16-10-2022

## Fixed

- Quick fix, forgot to update the module-info.java and CHANGELOG.md

## [11.7.0] - 16-10-2022

## Added

- Implemented paginated version of VirtualGrid: PaginatedVirtualGrid
- Added tests for the PaginatedVirtualGrid

## Changed

- Upgrade JavaFX to version 19
- Upgrade JavaFX plugin to version 0.0.13
- Upgrade JUnit to version 5.9.0
- Upgrade MFXCore to 11.1.2
- VirtualScrollPane: moved wrap() methods to utility class VSPUtils
- PaginatedHorizontalHelper: override scrollToPixel to be unsupported
- PaginatedVirtualFlow: minor documentation fixes and code refactors
- Major refactor of VirtualGrid and its components
- LayoutRow is now GridRow and it's much more useful and reliable
- GridHelper: convert estimated length and breadth properties to a single property, estimatedSize
- GridHelper: make invalidatePos() return a boolean value indicating whether the invalidation occurred or not
- AbstractGridHelper and DefaultGridHelper adapted to the aforementioned changes
- DefaultGridHelper: refactor rowsRange() and columnsRange() to always return clamped ranges, check docs
- Major refactor for GridState. It is now much more reliable on all core computations. Also, it is now able to correctly
  compute the transition caused by any Change type (add/remove rows and columns changes were buggy). Implemented code to
  layout rows for paginated grids.
- ViewportManager: refactored init() method, it now returns a boolean value indicating whether the computation lead or
  not to a layout request
- Major refactor for VirtualGrid too. The two positions (vPos and hPos) are now stored in a single bean to simplify
  things.
- Major refactor for VirtualGridSkin too. Actions performed by the various listeners have been moved to separate
  protected methods
- Completely re-organized app tests

## Removed

- GridCell: removed updateCoordinates method with linear index, for performance reasons it's better to always use the
  other one
- Removed GridIterator
- GridHelper: removed maxCells() method as unnecessary

## Fixed

- MFXScrollBarBehavior: fixed bug that was causing the thumb to bounce back when using the track to scroll, specifically
  when holding the track
- VirtualGrid: fixed onCellSizeChanged() not resizing cells in some specific cases due to ViewportManager.init() not
  leading to a layout request

## [11.6.1] - 22-09-2022

## Changed

- Addressed some TODOs

## [11.6.0] - 22-09-2022

## Added

- FlowState: adapt to above change
- VirtualFlow: improve documentation for styleable properties, mentioning the new CSS
- Moved dialogs to separate utility class
- Adapt controllers to above change, also add new test to add at user input position

## [11.5.1] - 08-09-2022

<h4>
Note that the changelog for this version also includes the below "Commits".
This to have a complete log of the changes that lead to this new version.
</h4>

## Changed

- FlowState: I realized that there's no need to store cells' position is a map and keep them sorted when needed. Now
  positions are kept in a TreeSet, the VirtualFlowSkin then uses two ListIterators to iterate at the same time on both
  the cells and the positions (from bottom, so both iterators go in reverse)

## Fixed

- FlowState: further improve the new addition algorithm. Fixed a bunch of bugs related to the last index computation, to
  the wrong computation of the targetSize for PaginatedVirtualFlows and to the wrong creation of PartialMappings when a
  FullMapping was needed instead

## [Commit] - 07-09-2022

## Changed

- Bump MFXCore to version 11.0.16
- Renamed ViewportState to FlowState
- Renamed StateProperty to FlowStateProperty
- VirtualFlowSkin: move itemsChanged listener code to protected method, needed by PaginatedVirtualFlowSkin subclass
- VirtualFlowSkin: move listChanged listener code to protected method, needed by PaginatedVirtualFlowSkin
- VirtualFlowSkin: adapted layout code to changes made to FlowState
- FlowState: inverted the layoutMap to Double -> Cell. This to make use of a TreeMap to always keep the positions
  ordered in reverse, thus avoiding a Collections.sort() in the computePositions() method

## Fixed

- MFXScrollBarSkin: fixed a bug that caused the thumb to be positioned outside the track in some specific occasions
- VirtualScrollPane: Sometimes it's also needed to invalidate the position of the virtual flow when the length changes
- PaginatedVirtualFlowSkin: sometimes the number of pages was not updated by listening on the estimatedLength property
  for some reason. Fixed by doing it every time the items list changes or the list changes
- FlowState: further testing proved that even the new algorithm to manage additions to the items list was still failing
  for both VirtualFlow and PaginatedVirtualFlow. Switched to a "mapping" technique which should finally work for both
- FlowState: also fixed algorithm to handle replacements in the items list as it was misbehaving in some specific
  occasions

## [Commit] - 02-09-2022

## Added

- Add new tests for both ComparisonTestController and PaginationTestController

## Changed

- Bump MFXCore to version 11.0.15
- Override toString() method for VirtualBounds
- ViewportState: make compute positions methods return the layout map
- Renamed AbstractHelper to AbstractOrientationHelper
- Moved estimated length and max breadth properties to super class
- The helpers now do not need the ViewportManager in the constructor as it can be retrieved from the virtual flow.
  Improvement for the orientationHelperFactory since the user cannot access the manager
- VirtualFlow, adapt to the aforementioned changes. Also add protected method to set the orientation helper
- Moved the cellSize invalidation code to separate method that can be overridden by subclasses if needed
- Improved PaginatedVirtualFlow management of the current page and max page
- Adapt PaginatedHelper to the aforementioned changes
- PaginatedVirtualFlow override cellSizeChanged() method to use goToPage() instead of scrollToPixel()
- Improved animation of cells' background

## Fixed

- VirtualScrollPane: fixed scroll bars' value not updating when the estimated length was changing
- ViewportState: fixed state transition which lead to NullPointerException is some rare cases. Also covered some extra
  cases specifically for the PaginatedVirtualFlow
- ViewportState: the algorithm responsible for transitioning to a new state in case of ADDITIONS is the virtual flow
  list has been completely rewritten as the previous implementation had some bugs for the original virtual flow and was
  also inadequate for the PaginatedVirtualFlow (2 or more bugs were found for that)
- ViewportState: the isViewportFull() methods now behaves differently for the PaginatedVirtualFlow, counting only the
  visible cells
- ViewportState: the getFirst() methods now behaves differently for the PaginatedVirtualFlow, instead of using the
  range's min value it now asks the OrientationHelper to compute the first visible cell. This is because of an issue
  occurring when a page was not full (some cells hidden, not enough items)
- ViewportState: the getLast() method now is more heavyweight since the returned value is now computed by finding the
  max index in the cells map. This at the benefit of 100% accuracy for both virtual flow implementations
- PaginatedHelper: Add scrollToPixel() method to the "forbidden" methods to avoid issues
- PaginatedVirtualFlow: fixed an issue that caused the display of the wrong page when changing the cells per page
  property
- PaginatedVirtualFlowSkin: added a listener on the estimated length property to fix an issue that caused the max page
  to not update when the length changed
- PaginationTestController: removed MFXSpinner in favor of custom solution. Needs to be fixed asap in MaterialFX
